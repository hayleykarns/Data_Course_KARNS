Final Project Idea:
I am doing a research project with faculty on mylonite and granite on the Deer Creek and Wasatch faults. We are analyzing these rocks based on the concentration of titanite in the quartz of these rocks, before and after deformation. The concentration of Titanite is being found through an electron probe to measure exact concentrations, but I have some data we have created using the visual measurements of the brightness of quartz as a proxy for the titanite concentrations. For this class, I want to use this data to create diffusion models of these quartz images to assist in my research analysis. The data should represent a typical diffusion curve profile.
